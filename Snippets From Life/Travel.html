        <h1 style="color:#ff5f5f">Trip To Te Puia<br>Newzealand</h1>
        <br><br><br><p>We’ve packed a whole lotta excitement into today. Just down the street from our hotel is Te Puia and NZ Maori Arts & Crafts Institute. Te Puia is a geothermal wonderland featuring dramatic geysers, bubbling mud pools, traditional arts and culture of Maori people, and a kiwi conservation program. I was able to see a kiwi in its (indoor) natural habitat which I never would have been able to do if it wasn’t in this conservation program. They are breeding and releasing into the wild trying to reestablish kiwis. Kiwis lay huge eggs which the female holds until it is almost ready to hatch before she lays it. Unlike other birds, the babies are born with feathers and their eyes open.<br><br> From the kiwi building we proceeded out to the geothermal area. This is like something you can’t even imagine - boiling mud pools plop little gobs of mud into the air along with steam; then the geysers and the steam flowing from a waterfall. There is a place where you can sit on the hot rocks and warm your behind. I had a strange feeling that we little humans were walking on top of a thin crust of volatile volcanic layers that might just decide to blow us into outer space at any time. After the geothermal experience, the tour went on to the Maori Arts & Crafts Institiute where Māoris learn their traditional skills of wood carving and weaving of NZ flax.</p>
